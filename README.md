# ShulkerPro

ShulkerPro is a Minecraft plugin that allows players to open shulker boxes directly from their hand by holding **Shift** and right-clicking. This eliminates the need to place the shulker box to access its contents.

The plugin preserves all items inside the shulker box and retains its custom name as the inventory title, providing a seamless experience. It works with shulker boxes in both the main hand and off-hand, and supports all colors.

ShulkerPro is ideal for survival gameplay, PvP, and mini-games where quick access to shulker contents can improve convenience and efficiency.
